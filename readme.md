Memory Card Game
========
Memory Card Game is a rugrats-themed memory card game.

Instructions: Match the four sets of cards. For each consecutive match, you win 25 points.

Technologies used / Approach taken
--------
I wireframed and pseudocoded, and took a functional based approach so that it was easier to debug. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the game.  


Unsolved Problems
------------
- Prevent user from clicking the same card twice
- Fix spacing (currently, too wide) from initial image to "flipped" image 


Installation 
------------

1. Fork repository 
2. Clone repository 
3. Open repository locally (use text editor of your choice e.g. VSCode, Sublime, Atom)
